We explore how iterative revising a chain of thoughts with the help of information retrieval significantly
improves large language models’ reasoning and generation ability in long-horizon generation tasks, while
hugely mitigating hallucination. In particular, the proposed method — retrieval-augmented thoughts
(RAT) — revises each thought step one by one with retrieved information relevant to the task query,
the current and the past thought steps, after the initial zero-shot CoT is generated. Applying RAT to
GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and CodeLLaMA-7b substantially improves their performances on various long-horizon
generation tasks; on average of relatively increasing rating scores by 13.63% on code generation, 16.96%
on mathematical reasoning, 19.2% on creative writing, and 42.78% on embodied task planning.

1. Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved
fruitful progress on various natural language rea-
soning tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Wang et al.,
2023a; Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022; Zhou
et al., 2023), especially when combining large-
scale models (OpenAI, 2023; Team, 2022) with
sophisticated prompting strategies, notably chain-
of-thought (CoT) prompting (Kojima et al., 2022;
Wei et al., 2022). However, there have been in-
creasing concerns about the factual correctness of
LLMs reasoning, citing the possible hallucinations
in model responses (Rawte et al., 2023) or the
intermediate reasoning paths, i.e. CoTs (Dhuli-
awala et al., 2023). This issue becomes more sig-
nificant when it comes to zero-shot CoT prompt-
ing, aka. “let’s think step-by-step” (Kojima et al.,
2022) and long-horizon generation tasks that re-
quire multi-step and context-aware reasoning, in-
cluding code generation, task planning, mathe-
matical reasoning, etc. Factually valid interme-
diate thoughts could be critical to the successful
completion of these tasks.
Several prompting techniques have been
proposed to mitigate this issue, one promis-
ing direction, Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020b) seeks insights from
human reasoning (Holyoak and Morrison, 2012),
and utilizes retrieved information to facilitate
more factually grounded reasoning. In this paper,
we explore how to synergize RAG with sophis-
ticated long-horizon reasoning. Our intuition is
that the hallucination within the intermediate
reasoning process could be alleviated through
the help of outside knowledge. The resulting
prompting strategy, retrieval-augmented thoughts
(RAT), is illustrated in Figure 1. Our strategy com-
prises two key ideas. Firstly, the initial zero-shot
CoT produced by LLMs along with the original
task prompt will be used as queries to retrieve
the information that could help revise the possi-
bly flawed CoT. Secondly, instead of retrieving
and revising with the full CoT and producing
the final response at once, we devise a progres-
sive approach, where LLMs produce the response
step-by-step following the CoT (a series of sub-
tasks), and only the current thought step will
be revised based on the information retrieved
with task prompt, the current and the past CoTs.
This strategy can be an analogy to the human
reasoning process: we utilize outside knowledge
to adjust our step-by-step thinking during com-
plex long-horizon problem-solving (Holyoak and
Morrison, 2012). A comparison of RAT and coun-
terparts can be found in Figure 2.
We evaluate RAT on a wide collection of chal-
lenging long-horizon tasks, including code gen-

Figure 1 | Pipeline of Retrieval Augmented Thoughts (RAT). Given a task prompt (denoted as I in the
figure), RAT starts from initial step-by-step thoughts (𝑇1, 𝑇2, · · · , 𝑇𝑛) produced by an LLM in zero-shot (“let’s
think step by step”). Some thought steps (such as 𝑇1 in the figure) may be flawed due to hallucination. RAT
iteratively revises each thought step (𝑇★

eration, mathematical reasoning, embodied task
planning, and creative writing. We employ sev-
eral LLMs of varied scales:
GPT-3.5 (Brown
et al., 2020), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), CodeLLaMA-
7b (Rozière et al., 2023). The results indicate that
combing RAT with these LLMs elicits strong ad-
vantages over vanilla CoT prompting and RAG
approaches. In particular, we observe new state-
of-the-art level of performances across our selec-
tion of tasks: 1) code generation: HumanEval
(+20.94%), HumanEval+ (+18.89%), MBPP
(+14.83%), MBPP+ (+1.86%); 2) mathemat-
ical reasoning problems: GSM8K (+8.36%), and
GSMHard (+31.37%); 3) Minecraft task plan-
ning (2.96 times on executability and +51.94%
on plausibility); 4) creative writing (+19.19%
on human score). Our additional ablation studies
further confirm the crucial roles played by the
two key ingredients of RAT: revising CoT using
RAG and progressive revision & generation. This
work reveals how can LLMs revise their reasoning
process in a zero-shot fashion with the help of
outside knowledge, just as what humans do.
2. Retrieval Augmented Thoughts
Our goal is to support long-horizon reasoning and
generation while mitigating hallucination when
using LLMs. To have satisfying performance on
long-horizon tasks, two ingredients are indispens-
able. Firstly, access to factual information can
be facilitated by retrieval. Secondly, appropriate
intermediate steps that outline a scratchpad to
finish complex tasks, can be facilitated by CoT.
Yet, a naive combination of the two would not
necessarily yield improvements. Two questions
still persist: (1) what is relevant information to
retrieve; (2) how to effectively correct reasoning
steps with relevant factual information. To better
appreciate our method and why our method can
address these two questions, we first provide a
brief preliminary introduction of RAG and CoT.

viding LLMs with relevant text extracted from
trusted sources. It is primarily used in question-
answering (QA) tasks (Lewis et al., 2020b).
Specifically, given a set of 𝑛candidate documents
𝑅:= {𝑅𝑖}𝑛
𝑖=1, RAG aims to retrieve the most rel-
evant ones w.r.t. a query 𝑄, which can be the
question/task prompt itself or relevant informa-
tion generated by LLMs. To achieve this, RAG first
extracts semantic-aware embeddings of the docu-
ments 𝑟𝑖:= emb(𝑅𝑖) ∈ℝ𝐾(𝐾is the size of the em-
bedding) as well as the query 𝑞:= emb(𝑄) ∈ℝ𝐾.
emb(·) can be implemented with various text em-
bedding models, such as Sentence-BERT (Reimers
and Gurevych, 2019). The relevance between the
query and a document is measured by their cosine
similarity:
sim(𝑄, 𝑅𝑖) =
𝑞· 𝑟𝑖
∥𝑞∥∥𝑟𝑖∥.
Based on their relevance, the top-ranked 𝑘doc-
uments are then fed into the prompt for LLMs
to generate the final answer. With such rich and
factual contexts, RAG mitigates the hallucination
of LLMs. However, complex reasoning tasks (e.g.,
those requiring multi-step reasoning) can be diffi-
cult to translate into effective search queries, lead-
ing to challenges in finding relevant documents
and making RAG less applicable. Traditionally,
RAG retrieves all relevant information at once.
Yet, it overlooks the fact that it is difficult to pre-
dict what “facts" or information is required in the
subsequent reasoning and generation steps. The
task prompt itself is hardly sufficient to provide
enough clues for this.
Chain of Thoughts (CoT) prompting is designed
to enhance the performance of LLMs under tasks
that require complex reasoning steps (Wei et al.,
2022), such as multi-step math word problems.
Specifically, instead of tasking LLMs to generate
the correct answer directly, CoT prompting in-
centivizes LLMs to first output intermediate rea-
soning steps, termed thoughts, that serve as a
scratch space for the task, before summarizing

⊲Output 𝑇★as the final generation

of LLMs can either be stimulated in zero-shot by
prompting terms that encourage CoT reasoning
(e.g., “let’s think step by step”) (Kojima et al.,
2022), or triggered by few-shot examples that
perform CoT in similar tasks. However, since no
direct supervision is posed to the intermediate
thoughts, LLMs could make errors due to the lack
of relevant domain knowledge (Touvron et al.,
2023) or biased by hallucinations (Rawte et al.,
2023).
2.2. Our Approach
Our intuition to mitigate the issues of CoT prompt-
ing and RAG mentioned above is to apply RAG
to revise every thought step generated by CoT
prompting. An overview can be found in Figure 1
and Algorithm 1. Specifically, given a task prompt
I, we first prompt LLM to generate step-by-step
thoughts in zero shot (“let’s think step-by-step”)
𝑇:= {𝑇𝑖}𝑛
𝑖=1, where 𝑇𝑖represents the 𝑖th thought
step. In long-horizon generation tasks, 𝑇can ei-
ther be the intermediate reasoning steps, e.g. the
pseudo code with comments in code generation,
article outline in creative writing, etc., or the draft
response itself, e.g. a list of sub-goals in embodied
task planning as shown in Figure 1.
Since 𝑇could be flawed (e.g., contains halluci-
nation), we proceed to use RAG to revise every
generated thought step before generating the fi-
nal response from these thoughts. Specifically, as-
suming we have fixed the previous thought steps
and now are about to revise 𝑇1:𝑖, we begin by
converting the text {I, 𝑇1, . . . , 𝑇𝑖} into a query 𝑄𝑖:
𝑄𝑖= ToQuery(I, 𝑇1, . . . , 𝑇𝑖),
where ToQuery(·) can either be a text encoder
or an LLM that translates the task prompt I, the
current and the past thought steps 𝑇1, . . . , 𝑇𝑖into
a query 𝑄𝑖that can be processed by the retrieval
system. We adopt RAG to retrieve relevant docu-
ments 𝑅𝑖using 𝑄𝑖, which are then prepended to
the prompt to generate a revised thought step 𝑇★
𝑖.
𝑇★
1:𝑖= 𝑝𝜃(·|I, 𝑇1, . . . , 𝑇𝑖, 𝑅𝑖).
Finally, depending on the actual task, the revised
thought steps 𝑇★
1:𝑛can simply be used as the final
model response, e.g., embodied task planning.
For tasks like code generation, or creative writing,
the LLM will be further prompted to produce
the complete response (code, passage) from each
revised thought step in a step-by-step fashion.
Note that, when revising the 𝑖-th thought step
𝑇𝑖, instead of using the current step 𝑇𝑖only, or
the complete chain of thoughts 𝑇1, . . . , 𝑇𝑛to pro-
duce the query for RAG, we ensure the query
𝑄𝑖is produced from the current thought step 𝑇𝑖
and previous revised thought steps 𝑇★
1:𝑖−1, i.e., we
adopt a casual reasoning to revise the thoughts
using RAG:
𝑄𝑖= ToQuery(𝐼, 𝑇★
1:𝑖−1, 𝑇𝑖)
𝑇★
1:𝑖= 𝑝𝜃(·|𝐼, 𝑇★
1:𝑖−1, 𝑇𝑖, 𝑅𝑖).
This allows for the correction of errors in the
original thoughts 𝑇by continually consulting dif-
ferent reference texts and ensures that each step
4
Retrieval Augmented Thoughts Elicit Context-Aware Reasoning in Long-Horizon Generation
of reasoning is informed by the most accurate and
relevant information, significantly improving the
quality and reliability of the generated output.
Our hypothesis why our method can address
the two problems mentioned at the beginning of
this section is as follows. Firstly, the most straight-
forward way to know what information will be
used in complex reasoning is to “see” the reason-
ing steps. Our approach leverages all the gen-
erated thoughts along with the task prompt to
provide more clues for more effective retrieval.
Secondly, some information cannot be directly
retrieved, especially information related to the
final answer to a hard complex question. Instead,
retrieval of information relevant to intermediate
questions, which are assumed to be easier, is more
accessible. Thanks to the compositional nature of
many reasoning tasks, an iterative retrieval pro-
cess could also be more effective. Thirdly, correct-
ing potential hallucinations needs to be targeted.
Revising a complete CoT with RAG could intro-
duce errors at otherwise already-correct steps.
Revising every step one by one could be more
reliable. The first two points address question (1)
and the last point addresses question (2). Quan-
titative evidence can be found in our ablation
studies in subsection 3.4.
3. Experiments
We test our proposed method RAT on a diverse set
of benchmarks that highlight long-horizon gener-
ation and reasoning. Existing methods tradition-
ally struggle in those benchmarks; “hallucinated"
steps are obvious in LLMs’ outputs. Those steps ei-
ther fail to stick to the original query or are plainly
invalid. We kindly refer readers to subsection
3.3 (case analysis) for a more detailed discussion.
Due to space constraints, we do not introduce
each benchmark setting, nor do we discuss our
results in each benchmark in full length. Rather,
this section provides a comprehensive demonstra-
tion of our method’s performance and provides a
spotlight to provide preliminary empirical analy-
sis about why and when our method works and
when it fails.
3.1. Experimental Setups
We adopt four groups of benchmarks.
Code Generation includess HumanEval (Chen
et al., 2021), HumanEval+ (Liu et al., 2023b),
MBPP (Austin et al., 2021), and MBPP+ (Liu
et al., 2023b). These benchmarks encompass a
wide range of programming problems, from sim-
ple function implementations to more complex
algorithmic challenges, providing a robust testbed
for assessing generative capabilities.
Mathematical Reasoning evaluation is con-
ducted on GSM8K and GSM-HARD dataset, which
comprises thousands of multi-step mathematical
problems (Cobbe et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2022).
Creative Writing tasks are conducted to evalu-
ate the versatility of RAT, including survey, sum-
marization etc., highlighting different aspects of
open-ended text generation.
Embodied Planning tasks are evaluated on open-
ended environments Minecraft. A set of 100 tasks
ranging from simple objectives to challenging
diamond objectives are evaluated through MC-
TextWorld (Lin et al., 2023).
Evaluation Metrics. For code generation, the
classical pass rate pass@k is selected as the evalu-
ation metrics (Chen et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023b),
𝑘denotes the sampling number. We compute ac-
curacy to evaluate every question in mathemati-
cal reasoning tasks, aligning with the established
metric for the GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). For
embodied planning tasks, we compute the plan
execution success rate in MC-TextWorld as exe-
cutability (Lin et al., 2023). We also conduct hu-
man elo rating evaluation to compute the trueskill
rating score (Herbrich et al., 2006) for embod-
ied planning (as plausibility) and creative writing
tasks. These indicators are better the higher they
are.
Baselines. To establish a comprehensive and eq-
uitable comparison landscape, we incorporate
a suite of baseline methods. Our baselines in-
clude the original language models, referred to
as DIRECT, and the Retrieval-Augmented Gen-
eration (RAG) methodology with 𝑛retrieved ex-
amples, instantiated in both single-shot (1 shot)
and multi-shot (5 shots) configurations, as doc-

umented by Lewis et al. (2020b). Additionally,
we examine the zero-shot CoT (CoT) approach,
as conceptualized by Kojima et al. (2022), which
simulates a step-by-step reasoning process to fa-
cilitate complex problem-solving tasks under zero
demonstration. For different methods, the same
language model is used as base models. To en-
sure a fair comparison, none of the methods used
examples from the benchmark as demonstrations
for in-context learning.
RAG Settings.
RAT leverages the capabili-
ties of Retrieval-Augmented Generation meth-
ods, which enhance the performance of lan-
guage models by integrating external knowl-
edge
sources.
Specifically,
we
employed
the codeparrot/github-jupyter dataset as
our primary search vector library for code gen-
eration and mathematical reasoning tasks. For
embodied planning tasks in Minecraft, we utilized
the Minecraft Wiki1 and DigMinecraft2 websites
as the information sources accessible to the LLMs.
1https://minecraft.wiki/
2https://www.digminecraft.com/
For open-ended creative writing tasks, we use
Google to search the query on the Internet. We
utilized OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002
API service for all embedding calculations across
different methods and base models.
Acknowledging the risk of benchmark contam-
ination (an issue where the code library may con-
tain solutions to the exact problems being eval-
uated), we adopted a rigorous pre-processing
methodology as described by Guo et al. (2024).
The potential implications of benchmark contam-
ination, along with the effectiveness of our pre-
processing strategy, are discussed in detail in Ap-
pendix D.
3.2. Results
The code generation results presented in Table 1
and results on other benchmarks presented in
Table 2 demonstrate the comprehensive evalu-
ation of the RAT across multiple benchmarks.
RAT consistently outperforms the other methods
across the majority of the benchmarks and met-
6
Retrieval Augmented Thoughts Elicit Context-Aware Reasoning in Long-Horizon Generation
rics, showcasing its superior ability to generate
long-horizon context. Notably, in the HumanEval
and HumanEval+ benchmarks of code genera-
tion, RAT achieves remarkable improvements in
pass@1 and pass@5 rates, indicating a signifi-
cant enhancement in first-attempt accuracy and
within the top five attempts. For example, on the
HumanEval benchmark, RAT improves pass@1 by
up to 20.94% and pass@5 by up to 25.68% rela-
tive to the base models’ performances. This trend
is observed across different underlying base mod-
els, highlighting RAT’s effectiveness regardless of
the initial model’s capabilities. For mathematical
reasoning tasks, RAT demonstrates a significant
relative improvement, with an 8.37% increase in
accuracy on GSM8K and a remarkable 31.37%
increase on GSMHard, culminating in an overall
average improvement of 18.44% when deployed
on the GPT-3.5 model. RAT significantly outper-
forms all other methods on open-ended embodied
planning tasks in Minecraft, achieving the highest
scores with 76.67±8.02% for executability and
29.37 human rating score for plausibility, demon-
strating its superior ability to generate feasible
and contextually appropriate plans in the com-
plex open-world environment. RAT’s superior per-
formance also keeps across a broad spectrum of
creative writing tasks. Its ability to generate high-
quality content in diverse scenarios was demon-
strated, highlighting its potential as a powerful
tool for enhancing the general creative writing
capabilities of LLMs in open-ended scenarios.
The tasks are extremely diverse, while RAT can
have consistent improvements over all baselines.
These results underline the advantages of RAT’s
approach, which leverages iterative refinement
of retrieval queries based on evolving reasoning
thoughts. This strategy not only enhances the
relevance and quality of the information retrieved
but also significantly improves the accuracy and
efficiency of the generated context.
3.3. Case Analysis
Here we take the embodied planning task and
creative writing task to do case analysis.
In a manner analogous to multi-document
question-answering tasks (Trivedi et al., 2022a),
the task of long-horizon planning in Minecraft
is knowledge-dense, requiring consideration of
various items for the completion of each task.
However, open-world Minecraft knowledge on
the internet is fragmented, making task comple-
tion often dependent on information from mul-
tiple sources. We observed that while language
models like ChatGPT can identify necessary items
through zero-shot CoT reasoning, inaccuracies
in procedural steps are common. For example,
ChatGPT inaccurately identified the materials for
a crafting table as 4 wood blocks (the right an-
swer is 4 planks), indicating lower executability
reliability in CoT plans. Classical RAG algorithms,
retrieving the knowledge with the question as a
query and focusing on the final target item, inade-
quately retrieve intermediary items, offering min-
imal task improvement. Contrastingly, RAT im-
proves upon CoT’s initial answers by continuously
refining thoughts with targeted retrieval, align-
ing closely with task progression and relevant
item knowledge. This methodology significantly
enhances planning effectiveness by ensuring a
comprehensive understanding and retrieval of all
items involved in a plan, highlighting the syn-
ergy between structured reasoning and dynamic
knowledge retrieval in addressing long-horizon
planning challenges in Minecraft.
In addressing open-ended creative writing
tasks, assessments of LM’s generations typically
focus on completeness and accuracy.
When
tasked with “summarizing the American Civil War
according to a timeline”, LMs under DIRECT and
CoT prompts often produce significant halluci-
nations. For example, the statement “The Civil
War officially began on April 12, 1860, when Con-
federate troops attacked Fort Sumter in South
Carolina, a Union-held fort” contains incorrect
information, where the year 1860 is erroneously
mentioned instead of the correct year, 1861.
Direct queries to the internet for this task tend
to retrieve limited events, frequently overlook-
ing the accurate start date of the war, April 12,
1861. Moreover, the RAG approach, which tends
to summarize content retrieved from searches,
often misses this event in its responses, whether
it’s RAG-1 or RAG-5. On the other hand, RAT
bases its search on a language model’s draft an-

swer, finding that hallucinations usually occur
in details, such as specific dates, which do not
hinder the search engine from identifying rele-
vant information like “American Civil War starting
date”. RAT utilizes the content retrieved to iden-
tify and correct errors in the draft answer rather
than merely summarizing the retrieved content.
Therefore, RAT can achieve a complete genera-
tion through reasoning and enhance the accuracy
and credibility of the answer by leveraging re-
trieved knowledge. Experimental results validate
the effectiveness of RAT.
3.4. Ablation Study
Ablation on retrieval in RAT. In this ablation
study, we investigate the influence of various re-
trieval strategies on the efficacy of RAT, focusing
on the optimization of content retrieval for im-
proving generative outputs. The experimental
results, detailed in Table 3, highlight the signif-
icant advancements achieved through the itera-
tive refinement of retrieval queries in RAT com-
pared to baseline methods. The baseline denoted
as RAG-1, employs a direct approach by using
the question itself as the retrieval query. In con-
trast, CoT+RAG enhances this process by utiliz-
ing the entirety of the reasoning thoughts output
by the language model as the query, aiming for
a broader contextual understanding. However,
RAT introduces a more dynamic method by em-
ploying continuously modified parts of reason-
ing thoughts as queries, which allows for a more
focused and relevant information retrieval pro-
cess. The comparative analysis shows that RAT
surpasses both the baseline and the CoT+RAG
method in terms of pass@1 and pass@5 metrics
across the HumanEval and HumanEval+ bench-
marks. Specifically, RAT demonstrates an 8.7 per-
centage point increase in pass@1 and a 7.9 per-
centage point increase in pass@5 over the base-
line in the HumanEval benchmark, and similarly

impressive gains in the HumanEval+ benchmark.
These improvements underscore the effectiveness
of RAT’s retrieval strategy, which by iteratively
refining next queries based on evolving reason-
ing thoughts and previous queries, ensures the
retrieval of highly pertinent information. This
process not only enhances the relevance of the
information retrieved but also significantly im-
proves the quality and accuracy of the final gen-
erated outputs. The results firmly establish the
superiority of RAT’s dynamic retrieval method
in leveraging contextual nuances to drive more
precise and effective generative processes.
Ablation on causal reasoning in RAT. In this
ablation study, we systematically examine the
impact of causal and non-causal reasoning ap-
proaches on the performance of the RAT system,
with the Chain of Thought (CoT) serving as our
baseline. Our findings, as summarized in Ta-
ble 4, reveal significant enhancements in gen-
eration capabilities when incorporating causal
reasoning techniques. Specifically, the causal ap-
proach, which iteratively performs reasoning and
retrieval, leads to notable improvements in both
pass@1 and pass@5 metrics across HumanEval
and HumanEval+ benchmarks. For instance, the
causal method outperforms the baseline (CoT)
by 11.9 percentage points in pass@1 and by 4.6
percentage points in pass@5 on the HumanEval
dataset. This approach contrasts with the non-
causal method, which, although also surpass-
ing the baseline, leverages the initial reasoning
thought to directly retrieve all necessary steps and
generate the final answer. The causal method’s
superior performance underscores the value of
sequential reasoning and information retrieval in
enhancing the accuracy and reliability of gener-
ated outputs. This iterative process likely aids in
refining the search and reasoning steps based on
continuously updated context, allowing for more
precise and relevant information retrieval, which
in turn supports more accurate final answers.

These results firmly establish the efficacy of causal
reasoning in long-horizon problem-solving tasks.
3.5. Robustness of RAT
RAT was rigorously validated across a diverse
set of tasks, including code generation, mathe-
matical reasoning, creative writing, and embod-
ied planning. This variety of tasks underscores
the generalization capability of RAT, demonstrat-
ing its robust performance across highly diverse
challenges. Furthermore, all our experimental
settings were conducted in a zero-shot manner;
we did not design task-specific prompts for RAT,
but rather used the simplest possible prompts
(which can be found in Appendix B) to articulate
questions or instructions for all methods. This
approach ensures RAT’s generalization ability in
open-ended scenarios.
The diversity of our evaluation was further en-
hanced by testing RAT across various language
models of differing capacities.
This included
CodeLlama-7b (Rozière et al., 2023), ChatGPT
(gpt-3.5-turbo) (Ouyang et al., 2022), and the
more advanced GPT-4 (gpt-4) model (OpenAI,
2023). Remarkably, RAT maintained its general-
ization capability across different scales of lan-
guage models, showing improvements in bench-
marks such as the HumanEval for code generation
tasks. Notably, the largest improvement was ob-
served with GPT-4, attributed to its superior abil-
ity for in-context learning from retrieved text. On
MBPP+, CodeLlama-7b based RAT has demon-
strated performance degradation. This decline
could be due to the limited in-context learning
ability of smaller language models.
For mathematical reasoning tasks, RAT demon-
strated a significant relative improvement, with
an overall average improvement of 18.44% when
applied to the GPT-3.5 model. This trend of im-
provement persisted with GPT-4, which achieved
a remarkable 10.26% relative improvement from
DIRECT to RAT. These findings highlight RAT’s
robustness and its effective enhancement of lan-
guage models’ performance across a spectrum of
computational and creative tasks.
4. Related Works
Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG). Re-
cently, RAG has gained popularity for boosting
the performance of LLMs by guiding their genera-
tion process using the retrieved knowledge (Zhao
et al., 2023). Without updating model parame-
ters that may be expensive (Lewis et al., 2020a)
or unstable (Ke et al., 2022a,b), RAG is a cost-
effective way for LLMs to interact with the exter-
nal world (Gu et al., 2018; Lewis et al., 2020a).
RAG is widely applied to downstream tasks, such
as code generation (Lu et al., 2022; Nashid et al.,
2023; Zhou et al., 2022b), question answer-
ing (Baek et al., 2023; Siriwardhana et al., 2023),
and creative writing (Asai et al., 2023; Wen et al.,
2023).
Reasoning-enhanced RAG. Some recent works
also leverage reasoning to enhance the perfor-
mance of RAG (Li et al., 2023b). For example,
IRCoT (Trivedi et al., 2022b) exploits CoT to gen-
erate better queries for retrieval, IRGR (Ribeiro
et al., 2022) performs iteratively retrieval to
search for suitable premises for multi-hop QA,
GEEK (Liu et al., 2023a) can choose to query ex-
ternal knowledge or perform a single logical rea-
soning step in long-horizon generation tasks, and
ITRG (Feng et al., 2023a) performs retrieval based
on the last-step generation. However, these pre-
vious RAG methods simply adopt a single query
to retrieve the knowledge for question-answering
tasks (Feng et al., 2023b; Gao et al., 2023), while
our proposed RAT performs retrieval using reason-
ing and draft answers in an autoregressive way,
which significantly improves the performance of
RAG in various tasks as demonstrated in Figure 2.
Language Model for Reasoning.
The ad-
vancement of reasoning in language models
has seen notable methodologies emerge since
CoT was proposed by Wei et al. (2022), which
showcased LMs’ ability to generate self-derived
problem-solving strategies.
This foundational
work spurred further innovations such as the least-
to-most prompting (Zhou et al., 2022a), zero-shot
CoT (Kojima et al., 2022), self-consistency (Wang
et al., 2022), zero-shot CoT without prompt-
ing (Wang and Zhou, 2024). Moving beyond
basic prompting, Creswell et al. (2022) intro-
9
Retrieval Augmented Thoughts Elicit Context-Aware Reasoning in Long-Horizon Generation
duced the Selection-Inference framework, while
Zelikman et al. (2022) developed STaR to refine
reasoning through model finetuning. Creswell
and Shanahan (2022) proposed a faithful reason-
ing model, segmenting reasoning into dedicated
steps, similar to Scratchpad’s approach by Nye
et al. (2021) for enhancing multi-step compu-
tation. Tree-of-Thought (Yao et al., 2023) and
Graph-of-Thought (Besta et al., 2023) also ex-
pand the reasoning paths into a complex struc-
ture instead of linear CoT. These methods usually
aim to improve the reasoning ability of LLM by
designing prompts or providing feedback from
the environment to assist in better planning and
decision-making (Li et al., 2023a; Shinn et al.,
2023; Wang et al., 2023c; Yao et al., 2022; Zhang
et al., 2023). However, RAT takes a different
approach by using RAG to access external knowl-
edge that can help LLM with its reasoning pro-
cess.
5. Conclusion
We
have
presented
Retrieval
Augmented
Thoughts (RAT), a simple yet effective prompting
strategy that synergies chain of thought (CoT)
prompting and retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) to address the challenging long-horizon
reasoning and generation tasks. Our key ideas
involve revising the zero-shot chain of thoughts
produced by LLMs through RAG with the
thoughts as queries, and causally revising the
thoughts & generating the response progressively.
RAT, a zero-shot prompting approach, has
demonstrated significant advantages over vanilla
CoT prompting, RAG, and other baselines on
challenging
code
generation,
mathematics
reasoning, embodied task planning, and creative
writing tasks.

Limitations
In this seciton, we discuss three limitations of our
RAT as follows.
One limitation of this work is that the perfor-
mance of RAT relies on the chain-of-thought rea-
soning and in-context learning (or RAG) capa-
bility of the base LLM. Since this work does not
involve any model training, the capability of base
LLM will not change when applying RAT. De-
spite RAT achieves significant improvement on
powerful LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, the
effect on smaller and weaker LLMs such as GPT-2
is questionable. On top of that, it is interesting
to further explore how to improve RAT via fine-
tuning weaker LLMs (Ke et al., 2023; Lin et al.,
2024).
Another limitation of this work is that the per-
formance of RAT also relies on the quality of the
retrieved knowledge. When we have an inferior
external knowledge base which is irrelevant to
the user query, the retrieved knowledge may be
unhelpful for LLMs to generate useful informa-
tion. Also, even if we select a relatively large
knowledge base that entails the relevant informa-
tion, it will be expensive to maintain and retrieve
from such a huge knowledge base and also hurts
the retrieval precision. An interesting and crucial
direction is to study how to build and evaluate
the quality of a knowledge base used for efficient
and effective retrieval.
It is noteworthy that the above two limitations
also apply to the traditional studies on retrieval-
augmented generation (RAG). The last limitation
of RAT is that we follow CoT to solve the problems
in a explicit step-by-step fashion. Sometimes step-
by-step thinking may be redundant for straight-
forward questions, while some questions require
more complex reasoning structures (e.g., tree-of-
thoughts (Yao et al., 2023)). It is also interesting
to explore the better reasoning methods for LLMs
in our future work.
Ethics Statement
All datasets and models are publicly accessible
except for OpenAI’s GPT series and the text em-
bedding APIs. We have not identified any signif-

icant ethical considerations associated with this
work. We believe our newly proposed RAT can
improve the generation of LLMs in various fields
and reduce LLMs’ hallucinations.

Retrieval Augmented Thoughts Elicit Context-Aware Reasoning in Long-Horizon Generation
A. Task Details
A.1. Code Generation
Benchmarks.
We select HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), HumanEval+ (Liu et al., 2023b),
MBPP (Austin et al., 2021), and MBPP+ (Liu et al., 2023b) as the code generation evaluation
benchmark. These benchmarks are commonly used to test the performance of code generation models,
which are briefly introduced below:
• HumanEval consists of 164 Python programming problems, each with a function signature,
docstring, body, and multiple unit tests (Chen et al., 2021).
• HumanEval+ includes the same programming problems as HumanEval, but with an additional
80 times more unit tests for each of the 164 problems (Liu et al., 2023b).
• MBPP is a collection of approximately 1,000 Python programming problems that are intended
to be solvable by beginner programmers. Each problem includes an English task description, a
code solution, and three automated test cases. We assess the sample test set from index 11 to
175 (Austin et al., 2021).
• MBPP+ consists of 399 tasks (Liu et al., 2023b), which are a subset of the original MBPP dataset.
Additionally, MBPP+ includes extra unit tests for each of the 399 problems (35 times more than
the original MBPP). We utilized the first 164 questions as our test set.
These benchmarks encompass a wide range of programming problems, from simple function imple-
mentations to more complex algorithmic challenges, providing a robust testbed for assessing the
generative capabilities of various models.
Metrics. We adopt the pass@k metric for evaluating the efficacy of various code generation algorithms,
following the methodology proposed by Chen et al. (2021) and extended by Liu et al. (2023b). This
metric quantifies the rate at which generated code snippets successfully execute and pass all test cases,
where 𝑘represents the number of attempts or samples generated by the model for each problem.
This approach allows us to rigorously assess the precision and reliability of code generation models in
producing functionally correct code across a diverse set of programming challenges.
Baselines. To establish a comprehensive and equitable comparison landscape, we incorporate a suite
of baseline methods and diverse code generation models. Our baselines include the original code
generation language models, referred to as DIRECT, and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
methodology with 𝑛retrieved examples, instantiated in both single-shot (1 shot) and multi-shot (5
shots) configurations, as documented by Lewis et al. (2020b). Additionally, we examine the zero-shot
CoT (CoT) approach, as conceptualized by Kojima et al. (2022), which simulates a step-by-step
reasoning process to facilitate complex problem-solving tasks under zero demonstration. To ensure
a fair comparison, none of the methods used examples from the benchmark as demonstrations for
in-context learning.
The diversity of our evaluation is further enriched by testing across various language mod-
els with differing capacities, including CodeLlama-7b (Rozière et al., 2023), along with Chat-
GPT(gpt-3.5-turbo) (Ouyang et al., 2022), and the more advanced GPT-4(gpt-4) model (Ope-
nAI, 2023). Recognizing the potential format discrepancies in code outputs, especially considering
that models like gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 may produce code in markdown format which is not
immediately executable, we implement post-processing steps to convert the original language model
outputs into a form that can be executed within a sandbox environment. This normalization ensures
that all models are evaluated under uniform execution conditions, thereby facilitating a fair and
direct comparison of their code generation capabilities. Through this methodological framework,
15
Retrieval Augmented Thoughts Elicit Context-Aware Reasoning in Long-Horizon Generation
we aim to provide a detailed and nuanced understanding of the performance landscape across a
spectrum of LLM-driven code generation approaches.
RAG Settings. RAT leverages the capabilities of Retrieval-Augmented Generation methods, which
enhance the performance of language models by integrating external knowledge sources. Specifically,
we employed the codeparrot/github-jupyter dataset as our primary search vector library. This
dataset is a comprehensive compilation of 452k markdown and code pairs, meticulously extracted
from Jupyter notebooks hosted on GitHub BigQuery, representing a rich repository of programming
knowledge and examples. We utilized OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002 API service for all
embedding calculations across different methods and base models.
A.2. Mathematical Reasoning
Benchmarks. Our evaluation framework for assessing mathematical reasoning capabilities leverages
two primary benchmarks: the GSM8K dataset, which comprises over 8,000 multi-step mathematical
problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), and the GSM-HARD dataset, an adaptation of GSM8K where numbers
in the questions are replaced with larger values to increase problem complexity (Gao et al., 2022).
This study employs the PAL methodology to scrutinize the mathematical reasoning results, involving
the utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) to parse natural language problems, generate inter-
mediary programmatic solutions, and subsequently execute these solutions via a Python interpreter.
The test set for each benchmark consists of samples ranging from index 1 to 200. Uniquely, our
approach does not use any examples for in-context learning, differing from the original PAL methods.
Metrics and Baselines. Accuracy serves as our principal metric for evaluation, aligning with the
established metric for the GSM8K benchmark. Each question undergoes three execution attempts,
with the average score recorded as the final result. The baselines, including DIRECT, CoT, RAG
(1 shot), and RAG (5 shots), are consistent with those outlined in code generation, facilitating a
comprehensive and comparative analysis across different code generation benchmarks. The RAG
settings are consistent with the code generation tasks.
A.3. Embodied Planning
We further conduct experiments on embodied planning benchmarks on open-ended environments
Minecraft (Lin et al., 2023).
Benchmarks. The complexity and vast item interconnectivity within the open-world Minecraft
present an ideal testbed for evaluating the LLM’s capability to generate long-horizon plans (Wang
et al., 2023b,c; Yuan et al., 2023). With thousands of items and intricate relationships between them,
obtaining a specific item in survival mode from scratch may involve dozens of intermediate items and
their quantitative relationships, such as crafting 1 crafting table from 4 planks. This setting rigorously
tests the planning abilities of LLMs instead of low-level control policies (Baker et al., 2022; Cai et al.,
2023a,b; Lifshitz et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2024). Moreover, Wang et al. (2023b) have identified
instances of hallucinations about Minecraft knowledge in OpenAI’s ChatGPT and a general scarcity of
Minecraft-related knowledge in open-source language models, making this task a suitable benchmark
for assessing the RAG algorithm’s effectiveness.
The planning prompts are aligned with those used in DEPS (Wang et al., 2023c), structured as
Python templates and evaluated using MC-TextWorld as detailed by Lin et al. (2023). A set of
100 tasks were randomly selected for the test set, ranging from simple objectives like obtaining a
crafting table to more complex goals such as crafting an iron helmet and even challenging making an
enchanting table. The task instruction is formulated as:
16
Retrieval Augmented Thoughts Elicit Context-Aware Reasoning in Long-Horizon Generation
• Give you nothing in the inventory, generate a step-by-step plan for the task of obtaining a
{placeholder:acacia_boat} in Minecraft survival mode, and describe the object Minecraft item
and its number at every step. For every step, start with ’STEP’ as start.
• Give you nothing in the inventory, generate a step-by-step plan for the task of obtaining a {place-
holder:diamond_pickaxe} boat in Minecraft survival mode, and describe the object Minecraft
item and its number at every step. For every step, start with ’STEP’ as start.
There are over 100 tasks involving different Minecraft items.
RAG Settings. For the retrieval component of the RAG algorithm, we utilized the Minecraft Wiki3 and
DigMinecraft4 websites as the information sources accessible to the LLMs. Data from these websites
was cleaned and formatted into markdown text, then segmented into trunks not exceeding 2000
tokens each, with embedding calculations performed using OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002
API service.
Evaluation Metrics. Based on the methodology of Huang et al. (2022), our evaluation of open-ended,
long-horizon planning in Minecraft focuses on both executability and plausibility. Executability pri-
marily examines whether a plan can be carried out, including the accuracy of each step’s preconditions
and effects. The executability is automatically calculated using MC-TextWorld (Lin et al., 2023).
However, executability only evaluates if an objective-level plan can be executed, without considering
the specific details involved in executing individual objectives. For instance, crafting a wooden pickaxe
requires placing a crafting table and arranging three planks and two sticks in a particular pattern,
which are important details for human execution but not assessed by MC-TextWorld. Therefore, we
complement our evaluation with human ratings to assess the plausibility of plans.
A.4. Creative Writing
To further understand the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models in enhancing
the creativity and relevance of generated content, we extend our investigation to open-ended text
generation tasks within the realm of creative writing.
Benchmarks. The versatility of RAT was tested through a series of creative writing tasks, each chosen
to highlight different aspects of open-ended text generation. These tasks include:
• Write
a
survey
paper
to
summarize
the
placeholder:Retrieval-augmented
Generation methods for Large Language Models.
• Describe of placeholder:Jin-Yong’s life.
• Summarize the placeholder:American Civil War according to the timeline.
For each task, three variants for placeholder were created to ensure a comprehensive evaluation
of the model’s performance across different contexts and requirements.
RAG Settings. Differing from previous tasks, creative writing is categorized as an open-ended
generation task, demanding a broader scope of information retrieval to aid content generation. To
accommodate this, Google was utilized as the search engine, with the top-k web pages converted into
markdown text to assist the LLM in generating outputs. This approach allowed LLM to leverage a
wide array of information sources.
Baselines and Evaluations. To benchmark RAT’s performance, we compared it against DIRECT,
RAG-1 shot, and RAG-5 shot methods, all based on the gpt-3.5-turbo model. The evaluation
3https://minecraft.wiki/
4https://www.digminecraft.com/
17
Retrieval Augmented Thoughts Elicit Context-Aware Reasoning in Long-Horizon Generation
was conducted by human experts, employing the TrueSkill rating system (Herbrich et al., 2006) to
calculate scores for each method. This evaluation framework enabled a comprehensive assessment of
each model’s creative output quality, accuracy, relevance, and innovativeness.
B. Prompt Details

C. TrueSkill Evaluation Framework
Part of the tasks in “Embodied planning” and “creative writing” involve using humans for labeling.
Human labelers have 4 choices: “A is better”, “B is better”, “Tie” or “Both are bad”. In this case,
“Tie” and “Both are bad” will be counted as a tie. For each task group, we have selected more than
10 professional annotators to provide labels. We use the Python “trueskill” package to calculate
the win rate and score. The default score for every method is set as 25. In order to facilitate user
understanding and selection, we also provide prompts when entering the system.
# Chatbot Arena : Benchmarking LLMs in the Wild
##Rules
- Refresh to obtain the question and its corresponding answers from two anonymous models.
- Vote for the better answer. And then click "New Round" to get a new question.
- If both answers are bad, vote for "Both are bad".
- If you want to skip, click "Skip".
## Principle
You can evaluate the performance of the model from the following aspects:
1. **Relevance**: Does it answer the question accurately?
2. **Accuracy**: Is it accurate? For example, a crafting table is made by combining 4 wooden planks, not 4 logs; a
diamond axe requires 3 diamonds and 2 sticks to craft, not 3 sticks and 2 diamonds.
3. **Completeness**: Is it complete? For example, crafting a wooden pickaxe from logs requires first crafting wooden
planks and then crafting sticks before finally being able to craft the pickaxe. The intermediate steps cannot be ignored.
4. **Readability**: Is it coherent?
5. **Executability**: Considering the characteristics of the game, is it executable?

D. Disscussions on Benchmark Contamination

generation benchmarks, we adopted a rigorous pre-processing methodology as described by Guo
et al. (2024). This process was meticulously designed to remove any direct matches or overly similar

code snippets from our search vector library, thereby ensuring that our evaluation remains fair and
uncontaminated by pre-existing solutions. This examination aims to underscore the importance of
maintaining the integrity of the evaluation process while utilizing external knowledge sources to
augment the capabilities of language models in code-generation tasks.

E. More Results
E.1. Emboddied Planning
Embodied planning involves multiple steps, each of which relies on specific world knowledge and
causal knowledge (i.e., preceding steps are usually preconditions for subsequent steps), including
recipes for items in Minecraft, tools for performing related actions, and quantity restrictions. Therefore,
although the plan generated by ChatGPT may appear complete and correct, there are often errors
within the steps that can affect the proper execution of the plan.
We mark the errors found in the generated plan in red.
Response E.1: Response from Zero-Shot CoT(based on ChatGPT-3.5) in embodied planning tasks
{instruction}
Give you nothing in the inventory, generate a step-by-step plan for the task of obtaining a golden apple in Minecraft
survival mode, and describe the object Minecraft item and its number at every step. For every step, start with ’STEP’ as
start.
{response from Original ChatGPT}
STEP 1: Start by punching trees to gather at least 4 logs. - Minecraft item: 4x Logs
STEP 2: Craft the logs into a crafting table. - Minecraft item: 1x Crafting Table
STEP 3: Place the crafting table on the ground and right-click on it to open the crafting interface.
STEP 4: Use the crafting interface to turn 4 of the oak planks into a wooden pickaxe.
- Minecraft item: Wooden Pickaxe
STEP 5: Find a cave or dig into the ground to gather some stone. Mine at least 8 blocks of stone using your wooden
pickaxe. - Minecraft item: 8x Cobblestone
STEP 6: Craft the cobblestone into a furnace using the crafting table. - Minecraft item: 1x Furnace
STEP 7: Place the furnace on the ground and right-click on it to open the furnace interface.
STEP 8: Use the furnace interface to smelt some iron ore. Place at least 3 iron ore in the top slot of the furnace and use
wooden planks as fuel in the bottom slot. - Minecraft item: 3x Iron Ingots
STEP 9: Craft the iron ingots into a bucket using the crafting table. - Minecraft item: 1x Bucket
STEP 10: Find a water source (such as a lake or a river) and right-click on it while holding the bucket to fill it with
water. - Minecraft item: 1x Water Bucket
STEP 11: Look for an apple tree in a forest biome. Break some leaves until you find an apple. - Minecraft item: 1x Apple
STEP 12: Combine the water bucket and the apple in the crafting table to craft a golden apple. - Minecraft item: 1x
Golden Apple
Congratulations! You have successfully obtained a golden apple in Minecraft survival mode.
Although the Zero-shot CoT has generated a step-by-step plan overall, there are many factual errors
within it. These include recipe errors in STEP 2, where the crafting table requires planks instead of
wood; missing raw materials in STEP 4, as the wooden pickaxe needs 2 sticks but lacks the relevant
step in the plan; absence of instructions to use a stone pickaxe to mine iron ore in STEP 8; and an
incorrect recipe for golden apple in STEP 12, which should include gold ingots and an apple rather
than a water bucket.

There are still errors in the plan generated by RAT, such as the lack of tools before "STEP 8: smelt
iron ore into iron ingots", which should be “Mine 8 cobblestone to craft 1 furnace”. However, compared
to the errors in ChatGPT, the error rate in the plan has been significantly reduced.
We have also listed the links of the retrieved pages involved in different steps. We can see that the
text sources retrieved in each step generated by RAT are usually highly related to the synthesized
item of that step. Traditional RAG uses instructions for retrieval and can only find the final step. While
RAT can retrieve all links related to intermediate items, which improves the accuracy and plausibility
greatly.

Describe the history of the United States. {response from Original ChatGPT}
The history of the United States dates back thousands of years, with indigenous peoples such as the Native Americans
inhabiting the land long before the arrival of European settlers. However, the official history of the United States begins
in 1776 when the Founding Fathers declared independence from Great Britain. This marked the start of the American
Revolution, a conflict that ultimately led to the creation of the United States as an independent nation.
After gaining independence, the United States went through a period of rapid expansion in the 19th century. The country
acquired vast amounts of territory, including the Louisiana Purchase and the annexation of Texas. This expansion was
accompanied by conflicts, such as the Mexican-American War and the Civil War, which tested the unity of the nation.
In the 20th century, the United States emerged as a global superpower. The country played a significant role in both
World War I and World War II, eventually becoming the leader of the free world during the Cold War with the Soviet
Union. The United States experienced social and cultural shifts during this time, including the Civil Rights Movement
and the rise of consumerism.
Today, the United States remains a powerful nation, with a diverse population and a complex history that continues to
shape its identity.

Describe the history of the United States.
{response from Zero-shot CoT}
**Pre-Columbian Era**
The history of the United States begins long before the arrival of European explorers in the 15th century. The land was
initially inhabited by diverse Native American tribes, such as the Apache, Sioux, Iroquois, and Cherokee. These societies
had rich cultures, with their own languages, traditions, and social structures. They lived off the land, flourishing through
hunting, fishing, farming, and trade. However, the indigenous populations faced significant challenges, including
conflicts, displacement, and diseases brought by the European settlers.
**Colonial Period**
In the 16th century, European powers began to claim territories in what is now the United States. The Spanish were the
first to establish colonies, initially focusing on Central and South America. Later, English, French, and Dutch explorers
arrived, establishing their own colonies along the Atlantic coast. These colonies varied in purpose and organization, with
the English colonies primarily seeking economic opportunities and religious freedom. Over time, thirteen British colonies
emerged, forging their own identities, developing local governments, and experiencing an increase in population due to
immigration.
**American Revolution and Beyond**
Tensions between the British colonies and their colonial masters grew, leading to the American Revolution in 1775. The
colonies, unified under the Continental Congress, fought for independence from British rule. The war lasted several years,
until the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which granted the newly formed United States of America independence.
After achieving independence, the founding fathers convened to draft the Constitution, establishing the framework for
the new nation’s government.
This is just a brief overview, and the history of the United States is vast and complex. However, these steps provide a
simplified understanding of how the nation evolved from Native American civilizations to a group of British colonies, to
an independent country.
Response E.5: Response from RAG(1-shot) in creative writing tasks
{instruction}
Describe the history of the United States.
{response from RAG-1}
The history of the United States is a complex and rich tapestry that spans over four centuries. The story begins with the
arrival of European explorers and settlers in the 16th century. In 1492, Christopher Columbus reached the Americas,
which led to subsequent expeditions and colonization by the Spanish, French, Dutch, and English. The first successful
English settlement was established at Jamestown, Virginia in 1607.
Over the next few centuries, the colonies grew and developed their own unique cultures, economies, and systems of
government. Tensions rose between the American colonies and the British Crown, leading to the American Revolutionary
War in 1775. The colonies declared their independence in 1776 and formed the United States of America, which became
a republic based on democratic ideals and principles.
The young nation faced numerous challenges in its early years, including establishing a central government, expanding
westward, and dealing with the issue of slavery. The 19th century saw rapid westward expansion, the Industrial
Revolution, and the Civil War. The United States emerged from the Civil War as a more unified and powerful nation,
with the abolition of slavery and the preservation of the Union. In the 20th century, the United States became a global
superpower, playing a crucial role in both World Wars and the Cold War. It witnessed significant social movements for
civil rights and equality, as well as advancements in technology and innovation.
Today, the United States is a diverse and influential country with a strong economy, global military presence, and a
complex political landscape. Its history continues to shape its present and future, as the nation grapples with ongoing
social, economic, and political challenges.

Describe the history of the United States.
{response from RAG-5}
The history of the United States dates back to the colonization of the Americas by European explorers in the 16th century.
The first permanent English settlement was established in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. This marked the beginning of
British colonization in North America.
Over the next century, more British colonies were established along the eastern seaboard, including Massachusetts, New
York, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. These colonies grew and developed their own distinct cultures and economies.
Tensions between the colonies and the British government grew in the mid-18th century, leading to the American
Revolutionary War in 1775. The colonists, led by figures such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin
Franklin, fought for their independence from British rule.
In 1776, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, which declared the thirteen
American colonies to be independent states. This marked the birth of the United States of America.
Following the Revolutionary War, the Founding Fathers drafted the Constitution of the United States, which established
a federal government and outlined the rights and freedoms of American citizens. The Constitution was ratified in 1788
and is still the supreme law of the land.
Since its founding, the United States has experienced significant growth and development. It expanded westward
through the Louisiana Purchase and the annexation of Texas, and it eventually stretched from coast to coast. The country
also faced significant challenges, such as the Civil War, the Great Depression, and the Civil Rights Movement.
Today, the United States is a global superpower with a diverse population and a strong economy. It is known for its
democratic system of government, individual freedoms, and cultural influence.
Response E.7: Response from RAT in creative writing tasks

Describe the history of the United States.
{response from RAT}
The history of the United States is characterized by several significant phases. The pre-colonial period witnessed
diverse Native American populations with unique cultures inhabiting the land. This era transitioned into colonialism
through European exploration and settlement by powers such as the Spanish, French, Dutch, and British, leading to the
establishment of colonies along the East Coast with distinct economic and political frameworks.
A pivotal moment in American history was the American Revolution, beginning in 1775, as the colonies sought indepen-
dence from British rule. The Declaration of Independence in 1776 marked the nation’s founding on principles of liberty
and democracy, establishing autonomy from Great Britain. This revolutionary period not only birthed a republic based
on the will of the people but also forged American national identity, fostering a collective ethos entrenched in history
and culture, inspiring revolutions worldwide and aiding in the establishment of republican governments elsewhere.
The United States stands out as the first modern nation to achieve independence through a national war of liberation,
articulating its motives and aspirations in a declaration of independence. This event had global reverberations, spreading
fundamental values like liberty, equality, natural and civil rights, and civic duty. The formative years were shaped by the
drafting of the Constitution in 1787, defining the federal government’s framework. The subsequent ratification of the
Bill of Rights further cemented individual freedoms and outlined governance principles that have endured across the
nation’s history, ensuring a system of checks and balances that protect citizens’ rights.
The 19th century in the United States witnessed significant developments, including westward expansion, industrializa-
tion, and conflicts like the Civil War (1861-1865), which decisively addressed issues of slavery and reinforced federal
authority over the states. The late 19th and early 20th centuries were marked by rapid industrial growth, extensive
immigration, urbanization, and overseas expansion, including involvement in conflicts such as the Spanish-American War
and World War I. The 20th century saw the United States emerge as a global superpower after World War II, engaging
in the Cold War with the Soviet Union and participating in conflicts like the Korean and Vietnam Wars, significantly
impacting the nation’s foreign policy and global standing.
Recent history includes social movements for civil rights, gender equality, and environmental protection, as well as
economic shifts, advancements in technology, and challenges in areas such as healthcare and international relations.
